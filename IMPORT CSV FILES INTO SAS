# Syntax to import CSV file into SAS dataset in SAS

You can use PROC IMPORT to import a CSV files into SAS. The syntax of PROC IMPORT is as follows:

PROC IMPORT OUT=newdata
    DATAFILE="/home/deepanshu88us0/mydata.csv"
    DBMS=CSV
    REPLACE;
    GETNAMES=YES;
RUN;

(1) OUT: Specify name of the dataset to be imported into SAS dataset
(2) DATAFILE: File location of CSV file which you want to import into SAS dataset
(3) DMBS: Specify CSV Format which you want to import into SAS dataset
(4) REPLACE: Optional argument. By default, it overwrites the existing file.
    If the file already exists, set REPLACE=NO.
    If the file already exists, set REPLACE=YES.
    If the file already exists, set REPLACE= FIRST.
    If the file already exists, set REPLACE= LAST.
    If the file already exists, set REPLACE= ALL.
    If the file already exists, set REPLACE= REPLACE.
    If the file already exists, set REPLACE= APPEND.
(5) GETNAMES: Optional argument. By default, it takes the first row as variable names. If the file doesn't have a header, set GETNAMES=NO.

## Import Data from CSV File without Header into SAS Dataset using PROC IMPORT

If your CSV file does not have header, you can use GETNAMES=NO option in PROC IMPORT. If the file doesn't have a header, set GETNAMES=NO.

PROC IMPORT OUT=newdata
    DATAFILE="/home/deepanshu88us0/mydata/customers.csv"
    DBMS=CSV
    REPLACE;
    GETNAMES=YES;
RUN;

## Import Data from CSV File with Custom Delimiter into SAS Dataset using PROC IMPORT

By default, SAS considers comma (,) as a delimiter which separates the values in the CSV file when importing using PROC IMPORT.
To change delimiter, you can specify it in the DELIMITER= option in PROC IMPORT. The following code uses semicolon (;) as a delimiter.

PROC IMPORT OUT=newdata
    DATAFILE="/home/deepanshu88us0/mydata/customers.csv"
    DBMS=CSV
    REPLACE;
    DELIMITER=";";
    GETNAMES=YES;
RUN;

## Change Starting Row in PROC IMPORT to Skip Rows in CSV File using START= option in PROC IMPORT

You can use the DATAROW= option to import a CSV file from a specific row. The following code imports the CSV file from 5th row.
The following code imports the CSV file from 5th row.

PROC IMPORT OUT=newdata
    DATAFILE="/home/deepanshu88us0/mydata/customers.csv"
    DBMS=CSV
    REPLACE;
    DELIMITER=";";
    START=5;
    GETNAMES=YES;
RUN;

## Guess the Data Type when Importing a CSV File using PROC IMPORT

To guess the data type of a CSV file, you can use the GUESSINGROWS= option in PROC IMPORT.
The following code guesses the data type of the CSV file. The guess is based on the first 1000 rows.

PROC IMPORT OUT=newdata
    DATAFILE="/home/deepanshu88us0/mydata/customers.csv"
    DBMS=CSV
    REPLACE;
    DELIMITER=";";
    GUESSINGROWS=1000;
    GETNAMES=YES;
RUN;
