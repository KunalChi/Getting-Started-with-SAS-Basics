## Getting Data into SAS

SAS program windows include:
(1) Editor window: This is where you input your program. You can run the program by selecting "Submit" in the menu or pressing the F3 key. You can also submit only part of the statements.
(2) Log window: It displays information recorded during program execution. This includes executed statements, the number of variables and records in the generated data set, the time spent on each step, and error information.
(3) Output window: It displays the output of the SAS process.

3. SAS Data Set
A SAS data set is similar to a table in other database systems. Each row is called an observation, which is equivalent to a record in other database systems. Each column is called a variable. SAS variables have only two types: numeric and character. The default length of a variable is 8 bytes.

The main keywords are:
(1) LENGTH: It defines the length of a variable.
(2) INFORMAT/FORMAT: It defines the input and output formats of variables.
(3) LABEL: It adds a label to the variable, replacing the variable name.

SAS data sets are stored as files in the system with the extension .sas7bdat. 
Every time the SAS system starts, it automatically opens a temporary storage area named WORK to store data generated by DATA steps or other processes. 
This temporary storage is deleted, along with all temporary data files, when exiting the SAS system.

To create a permanent data set, you need to specify its storage location and name. The first part is called the library tag or logical library name. 

You use the LIBNAME statement to associate the library tag with a directory, indicating where the data set is stored.    
For example, to store data for the "develop" project in the "d:\projects\develop\data" directory, use the following library name:

    LIBNAME Statement Syntax:
    `LIBNAME libref 'SAS-data-library'<options>;`

    Example of LIBNAME Statement:
    `LIBNAME develop 'D:\projects\develop\data';`

If a data set is referred to as develop.t_tmp, it means the data set named t_tmp is stored in the "d:\projects\develop\data" directory. 
If it is referred to as tmp or work.tmp, it means the data set named tmp is stored in the temporary storage area.

There are four main methods to import data into SAS:
1. Enter data directly into SAS data sets.
2. Create SAS data sets from raw data files.
3. Convert data files from other software into SAS data sets.
4. Read data files from other software directly.

The choice of method depends on the location of your data and the software tools available to you. 
When using Base SAS software, you can use Viewtable to input your data in a tabular format. 
This allows you to define variables (columns) and assign attributes like name, length, and type (character or numeric). 
If you have Base SAS for Windows and SAS Enterprise Guide software, the data entry window in SAS EG is similar to the Viewtable window. 
Similarly, you can define variables and assign attributes in this window.
