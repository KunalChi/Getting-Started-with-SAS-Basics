The SAS Institute created SAS, a statistical analysis program, in the 1970s. It offers a range of analytical uses, including data management, business intelligence, and various types of analysis such as predictive, descriptive, and prescriptive analysis. The introduction of JMP (Jump) was a significant advancement as it introduced a graphical user interface, particularly beneficial in fields like Six Sigma, quality control, and engineering. SAS can operate on multiple operating systems, like Linux and Windows, due to its platform independence. SAS programmers play a crucial role in manipulating SAS datasets to generate insightful data analyses. Over the years, SAS has expanded its offerings, providing solutions for data governance, data quality, big data analytics, text mining, fraud management, and health science. Its wide range of solutions serves various business domains. SAS application plays a major role in statistical analysis and decision-making. Key domains that utilize SAS include multivariate analysis, business intelligence, predictive analytics, and clinical research. SAS is used to analyze statistical variables simultaneously, provide insights for decision-making, predict future trends, and support clinical decision-making in medicine.
