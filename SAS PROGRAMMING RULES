When it comes to programming in SAS, there are several best practices and rules that can help improve code readability, efficiency, and maintainability. Here are some important SAS programming rules to keep in mind:

I. Rules for SAS statements
  A) All SAS statements (except those containing data) must end with a semicolon (;). Example : "DATA example1;" is an example of a SAS statement.
  B) Any number of SAS statements can appear on a single line provided they are separated by a semicolon. Example : "DATA example1; Input Name $ ID;" is an example of a SAS statement.
  C) SAS statements typically begin with a SAS keyword. (DATA, PROC)
  D) SAS statements are not case sensitive, that is, they can be entered in lowercase, uppercase, or a mixture of the two. Example : SAS keywords (DATA, PROC) are not case sensitive
  E) A delimited comment begins with a forward slash-asterisk (/*) and ends with an asterisk-forward slash (*/). All text within the delimiters is ignored by SAS.

II. Rules for SAS names
  A) All names must contain between 1 and 32 characters.
  B) The first character appearing in a name must be a letter (A, B, ...Z, a, b, ... z) or an underscore (_). Subsequent characters must be letters, numbers, or underscores. 
     That is, no other characters, such as $, %, or & are permitted. Blanks also cannot appear in SAS names.
  C) SAS names are not case sensitive, that is, they can be entered in lowercase, uppercase, or a mixture of the two. (SAS is only case sensitive within quotation marks.)

III. Rules for SAS variables
  A) If the variable in the INPUT statement is followed by a dollar sign ($), SAS assumes this is a character variable. Otherwise, the variable is considered as a numeric variable.
