SAS provides a tracing facility that you can use to review the SQL code that SAS generates and passes to the DBMS. 
Specify the SASTRACE= option, as shown in this example for Netezza, to display the generated SQL in the SAS log.

In the example, the code tells SAS to show us the generated SQL code in the SAS log. The part that says "SASTRACE='," tells SAS to do this tracing.
Then, the code tells SAS to connect to a Netezza database using specific login information (server, database, username, and password).

```options sastrace=',,,d' sastraceloc=saslog nostsuffix msglevel=i;
libname mydb netezza server='myserver.com' database=mydbms user=myuser
   password=mypwd;```

After that, the code uses a procedure called "proc sql" to ask the database a question. 
In this case, it wants to know the count of records in a table called "class" in the database.

```proc sql;
  select count(*) from mydb.class;
quit;```

Finally, when the code runs, SAS generates a SQL query based on what we asked. It will look something like "select COUNT(*) from MYDBMS..class TXT_1". 
This code generates a query to a Netezza database:
select COUNT(*) from MYDBMS..class TXT_1
